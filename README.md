  "Fake News Detection Model"

  This project implements a machine learning model to detect fake news articles,
Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms,
this model distinguishes between real and fake news based on textual features.

~ Project Overview
  In recent years, the proliferation of fake news has created a need for reliable detection tools.
This project aims to address this issue by building a model capable of detecting fake news articles.
The dataset includes both real and fake news articles, which are used to train and evaluate the model.

~ Features
- Data Preprocessing : Text cleaning and tokenization using NLP techniques.
- Feature Extraction : Uses term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and other feature engineering methods.
- Model Training     : Applies various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
- Visualization      : Provides insights through visualizations like word clouds and data distribution plots.
